# If you require your clients to access more than one Docker Repository, you must use Nexus Repository Docker subdomain connector or an external load balancer (e.g., NGINX) as a reverse proxy instead of this ingress for Docker YAML.
# For reverse proxy see our help documentation at https://help.sonatype.com/repomanager3/nexus-repository-administration/formats/docker-registry/docker-repository-reverse-proxy-strategies
# For docker sub domain connector, see our help documentation at https://help.sonatype.com/repomanager3/nexus-repository-administration/formats/docker-registry/docker-subdomain-connector
#
# Note: This YAML file is just an example and cannot be used as-is.
# You must fill it out with the appropriate information for your deployment to be able to use it.
