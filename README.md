# Nexus Repository 3 High Availability (HA) Preview Program Helm and Sample YAML Repository
This repository contains resources for those in our **Nexus Repository 3 High Availability Preview Program**. 
Please refer to the documentation provided by your Customer Success Engineer for instructions on how to use these files.

## HA Preview Prerequisites and System Requirements
> **Warning** Do not deploy this preview version of HA in a production environment.

Along with the HA-specific requirements listed below, you should also ensure that you meet our [normal Nexus Repository system requirements](https://help.sonatype.com/repomanager3/product-information/system-requirements).

HA requires the following:
* A Nexus Repository 3 Pro license
* An external PostgreSQL database using Postgres 13 or later; size your database appropriately based on your request traffic and desired number of nodes
* At least 2 Nexus Repository instances
    * All Nexus Repository instances must be using the same Nexus Repository 3 Pro version, and it must be version 3.44.0 or later
    * All Nexus Repository instances must have identical configuration in their $data-dir/etc/nexus.properties files
* A load balancer (e.g., HAProxy, NGINX, Apache HTTP, or AWS ELB)
* A blob store location for storing components that can be commonly accessed by all active nodes
* Connectivity between Nexus Repository, the database, and blob store
* All architecture must be in one region (if deploying to cloud) or data center (if deploying on-premises)

If the Nexus Repository deployment will contain more than one Docker repository,  you must use one of the following:
* An external load balancer (e.g., NGINX) as a [reverse proxy](https://help.sonatype.com/display/NXRM3M/Docker+Repository+Reverse+Proxy+Strategies) instead of the provided ingress for Docker YAML 
* A [Docker Subdomain Connector](https://help.sonatype.com/repomanager3/nexus-repository-administration/formats/docker-registry/docker-subdomain-connector) with external DNS to route traffic to each Docker subdomain

## Helm Chart for an HA Nexus Repository Deployment in AWS 
We provide a [Helm chart for those deploying to an AWS environment](https://github.com/sonatype/nxrm3-preview-ha-repository/tree/main/nxrm-aws-resiliency).

## Sample YAML Files for an HA Nexus Repository Deployment
If you do not wish to use the Helm chart, you can use the sample YAML files in the [Sample AWS HA YAML Files section](https://github.com/sonatype/nxrm3-preview-ha-repository/tree/main/sample-aws-ha-yamls) to help set up the YAMLs you will need for a Nexus Repository HA deployment.

Ensure you have filled out the YAML files with appropriate information for your deployment.

> **Note** The YAML files in this section are just examples and cannot be copy-pasted and used as-is. You must fill them out with the appropriate information for your deployment to be able to use them.

## Format Limitations
For this preview program, HA supports Maven, Docker, and npm formats; once HA is available generally, it will support all formats that PostgreSQL supports.
